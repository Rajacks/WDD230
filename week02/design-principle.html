               <p>As you can see, the place is very beautiful with its white surroundings, as well as the New Government Center (NGC). 
                These are examples of the natural colors of my place, and I want to make it even more special and unique by incorporating its own cultural colors.
                However, I don't want to add too much. The products are the protagonists given that the brand use their pictures to add pops of color. 
                These colors are minimal, natural, and attractive.  </p>
